# Sentiment-based product recommendation system:

The e-commerce business is quite popular these days. Here, you do not need to take orders by going to each customer. A company launches its website to sell the items to the end consumer, and customers can order the products that they require from the same website. Here I have built a model that will improve the recommendations provided to the different users, given their past product reviews and ratings. 

Following steps have been taken to arrive at the final model:

1. Data sourcing and sentiment analysis
    - 1.1 Exploratory data analysis
    - 1.2 Data cleaning
    - 1.3 Text preprocessing 
    - 1.4 Feature extraction
    - 1.5 Training a text classification model *(DB: Data Balancing, HT: Hyperparameter Tuning)*
        - 1.5.1 Logistic regression (without DB or HT)
        - 1.5.2 Random forest (without DB or HT)
        - 1.5.3 XGBoost (without DB or HT)
        - 1.5.4 Naive Bayes (without DB or HT)
        - 1.5.5 Logistic regression (with DB)
        - 1.5.6 Random forest (with DB)
        - 1.5.7 XGBoost (with DB)
        - 1.5.8 Naive Bayes (with DB)
        - 1.5.9 Logistic regression (with HT)
        - 1.5.10 Random forest (with HT)
        - 1.5.11 XGBoost (with HT)
        - 1.5.12 Naive Bayes (with HT)
      
      
2. Building a recommendation system
    - 2.1 User-based recommendation system
    - 2.2 Item-based recommendation system
  

3. Improving the recommendations using the sentiment analysis model
  
  
4. Deploying the end-to-end project with a user interface
